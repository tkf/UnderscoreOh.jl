# UnderscoreOh exports `_o` for building anonymous "functions"

**WARNING** This package is *all about* syntax pun and interactive
convenience.  It is highly recommended to avoid using it inside any
serious packages and scripts.

## What is it?

UnderscoreOh.jl is a tool for building anonymous _callables_.  There
are several differences to the native anonymous functions and closures
created with syntax like `x -> ...` and `function (x) ... end`:

* The callables created with UnderscoreOh.jl are _identical_ when
  generated with the same expression and the same context.  It allows
  `julia` to re-use JIT-compiled anonymous callables.

* Simple callables are easier to build with UnderscoreOh.jl API.

* Variables are captured by value (i.e., no infamous `Box`ing).

## Property and index access

UnderscoreOh.jl exports `_o`.  Accessing properties and keys generate
a function that does that:

```julia
julia> using UnderscoreOh

julia> f = _o.key
_o -> _o.key (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f((key = 1, value = 2))
1

julia> map(_o.key, [(key = 1,), (key = 2,), (key = 3,)])
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3

julia> f = _o.x[1]
_o -> _o.x[1] (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f((x = (:a,), y = (:b, :c)))
:a
```

## A chained dot-calls as an anonymous callable

Broadcasting expression around this object becomes a unary function:

```julia
julia> f = _o.x .== _o.y
_o -> _o.x == _o.y (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f((x = 2, y = 2))
true

julia> f = _o .* 2 .+ 1
_o -> (_o * 2) + 1 (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(1)
3

julia> g(args...; kwargs...) = (args, (; kwargs...))
g (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f = g.(_o; x = _o .+ 1)
_o -> g(_o; x=_o + 1) (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(0)
((0,), (x = 1,))

julia> filter(_o.k .== 1, [(k = 1, v = :a), (k = 2, v = :b), (k = 1, v = :c)])
2-element Array{NamedTuple{(:k, :v),Tuple{Int64,Symbol}},1}:
 (k = 1, v = :a)
 (k = 1, v = :c)
```

## Standard broadcasting

The type of the function generated by `_o` overloads the `~` operator
(in such a way that it is nothing to do with bitwise not):

```julia
julia> ~_o.x
_o -> ~(_o.x) (generic function with 1 method)

julia> _o ~ _o.x  # equivalent
_o -> ~(_o.x) (generic function with 1 method)
```

If `f` is a function generated by `o_`, `~(f)` is also a function.
When invoked, this function acts like the one wrapped in `~`.

```julia
julia> _o.x((x = 1,))
1

julia> (~_o.x)((x = 1,))
1
```

However, it has the normal broadcasting rule so that it can be used to
mix dot-`_o` syntax with actual broadcasting

```julia
julia> sum.(~_o.x, [[(x=1,), (x=2,)], [(x=3,), (x=4,), (x=5,)]])
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
  3
 12
```

Note that `~ _o .* 2` does not work since it is parsed as `(~ _o) .* 2`.
It can be worked around by using the binary version `_o ~ _o .* 2`
where `_o` on the left side of `~` is just a marker for declaring the
anonymous function boundary.

(At this point, ordinary anonymous function `x -> 2x` is much simpler!
However, this form is included so that the expression can be used
without re-typing it.)

## Named tuples

UnderscoreOh.jl also exports `_nt`.  This function simply converts
keyword arguments to a named tuple for normal arguments:

```julia
julia> _nt(X = 1)
(X = 1,)
```

When the input contains `_o`, it creates a function that returns a
named tuple:

```
julia> _nt(a = _o.x .+ 1, b = 2)
_o -> _nt(; a=_o.x + 1, b=2) (generic function with 1 method)

julia> _nt(a = _o.x .+ 1, b = 2)((x = 1,))
(a = 2, b = 2)
```
